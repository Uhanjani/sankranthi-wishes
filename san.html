                <h3>In Andhra Pradesh, Sankranti is affectionately known as "Peddapandugi" because it brings a profound sense of financial prosperity to the community. The term encapsulates the joy and abundance felt by the people as they celebrate the successful sale of their paddy, signifying a prosperous agricultural season. Sankranti becomes a symbolic indication of good crop yield, and the festivities are infused with a unique blend of cultural traditions and economic gratification. The festival not only marks the culmination of their hard work but also reinforces the deep connection between agricultural success and the tangible benefits it brings to the lives of the residents in West Godavari, making Sankranti a truly significant and joyous occasion.</h3>

                       <center><h1> Bhogi</h1></center>
             <h3>The first day is called <strong>Bhogi</strong>. On this day, people discard old and derelict things and concentrate on new things causing change or transformation. At dawn, people light a bonfire with logs of wood, other solid fuels and wooden furniture at home that are no longer useful. The disposal of derelict things is where all old habits, vices, attachment to relations and material things are sacrificed in the sacrificial fire of the knowledge of Rudra, known as the "Rudra Gita Gyana Yagya". It represents realization, transformation and purification of the soul by imbibing and inculcating divine virtues.</h3>

After seeking blessings, the Bhogi Pallu is joyously scattered over family members, symbolizing the dispelling of negativity and the welcoming of prosperity. This tradition holds communal significance, often celebrated collectively in neighborhoods. Alongside Bhogi Pallu, the lighting of bonfires called "Bhogi Mantalu" further marks the day, creating a vibrant and symbolic start to the Sankranti festivities in Andhra Pradesh.</h3>
